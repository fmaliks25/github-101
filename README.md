Vision Transformer (ViT) Architecture
Overview
Vision Transformers (ViTs) are a revolutionary neural network architecture designed for image classification tasks, inspired by the Transformer models used in natural language processing. Introduced by Dosovitskiy et al. in 2020, ViTs have shown that pure transformer models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks, rivaling or surpassing traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Key Features
Patch Embedding: Images are divided into fixed-size patches, each of which is linearly embedded into a high-dimensional space.
Transformer Encoder: The embedded patches are fed into a standard transformer encoder, which consists of multi-head self-attention layers and feed-forward neural networks.
Classification Head: A classification token is appended to the sequence of embedded patches, and its representation at the output of the transformer encoder is used for classification.
Architecture
Patch Embedding
An image of size 
𝐻×𝑊×𝐶
H×W×C is split into patches of size 
𝑃×𝑃P×P. Each patch is flattened and projected to a vector of size 
𝐷D, where 𝐷D is the embedding dimension.

Number of patches=𝐻𝑊𝑃2
Number of patches= P 2HW
​
 

Transformer Encoder
The transformer encoder consists of 𝐿L layers, each comprising:

Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA): Captures relationships between different patches.
Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN): Applies non-linear transformations to the attention outputs.
Layer Normalization: Normalizes the inputs to the attention and FFN layers.
Residual Connections: Helps in training deeper networks by adding the input to the output of each layer.
Classification Head
A special learnable embedding, known as the class token (𝐶𝐿𝑆CLS), is concatenated with the patch embeddings. After passing through the transformer encoder, the representation corresponding to this token is used for classification.

Advantages
Scalability: ViTs can be scaled up to very large sizes with fewer inductive biases than CNNs.
Performance: They have achieved state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.
Flexibility: Can be adapted to various image-related tasks beyond classification, such as object detection and segmentation.
Conclusion
Vision Transformers offer a novel approach to image classification by leveraging the power of transformer models. With their ability to handle large datasets and achieve impressive performance, ViTs represent a significant step forward in the field of computer vision.
