The Vision Transformer (ViT) model leverages the powerful self-attention mechanism of Transformers for image classification.
It breaks an image into patches, embeds these patches, and processes them through a Transformer encoder, culminating in a classification head that predicts the image class.
This approach allows ViT to capture long-range dependencies and relationships within the image, often leading to superior performance on various vision tasks.
